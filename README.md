# Back-end

Creation of a VPN and encrypted database.

## gameplan to begin with:

1. get server off the ground with simple client with diagnosis
2. Have server be able to log credentials and return to client their current IP address
3. Incorporate Encryption to our incoming/outgoing traffic (handle latency issues when needed)
4. Allow change of IP (most likely take over serverâ€™s IP)
5. Begin working on front end
   - On/off button
   - Kill switch
   - Can incorporate nicer UI than terminal used in the beginning
6. Success
